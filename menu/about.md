I am a mechanical engineer currently working in the steel industry in the areas of mechanical design and maintenance, but who as a passion by data analysis and programming in general. I really enjoy to develop code for data and numerical analysis. 

In addition, I am doing a master's degree at UFRJ in the area of rotordynamics including the creation of a numerical code for modeling the transient response during rotor-stator contact by the finite element method.
